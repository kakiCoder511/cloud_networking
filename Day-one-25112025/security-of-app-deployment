If you finish the VPC documentation task, or get bored, you  could try to improve the security of our app and database deployment WITHOUT making/creating a VPC.

Some ideas:
- Disable public IP for the db instance
- Make SG rules only allow specific IP address for the db connection

If you do these or find other ways to improve security then please be open to sharing them tomorrow morning.
